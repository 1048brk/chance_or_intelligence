1) You have 10 numbers and by using them and arithmatical functions, you need to find the greatest number.
2) But remember that your number only has to be greater than the number of others.
3) First open the folder called numbers and than learn the content by using ls command.(for example digits6 means 6)
4) In the numbers folder, there are 10 different numbers and you have to use 8 of them(not less or more than 8)
5) In the functions folder, there are 4 files, you can not open them. Every file has a mathematical function(+,-,*,/)
6) You have to write 2 numbers for each function(2 numbers for Turkey, 2 numbers for Ethiopia etc. for example echo "4 and 5" >> switzerland.txt)
7) You can use each number only once.
7) After moving your numbers(in total 8) to the files in functions folder, read the files to learn their function.
8) Then create a new txt file in the chance_or_intelligence folder and calculate your result. 
9) For example you select 3 and 4 and write them to Ukraine folder. So calculate 3 and 4 according to Ukraine's function and then sum all the results that you receive from functions files.
10) Who reaches the greatest number earns a swiss chocolate :)
